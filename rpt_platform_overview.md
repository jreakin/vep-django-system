# VEP Django System - Platform Overview Report

## Executive Summary

The VEP Django System is a comprehensive political campaign management platform designed to streamline campaign operations, voter engagement, and data management. Built with Django REST Framework and React, the system provides a scalable, secure solution for political organizations ranging from individual campaigns to multi-state operations.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (Django REST API)
- **Framework**: Django 4.2.16 with Django REST Framework 3.14.0
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with Spectacular (Swagger/ReDoc)
- **Authentication**: Token-based with phone/PIN verification

### Frontend (React Application)
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for responsive design
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with TanStack Query
- **Routing**: React Router v7

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Tier Access Control System
The platform implements a sophisticated hierarchical permission framework:

```
Owner ──→ Full system access
  ↓
State ──→ Counties & campaigns in their state  
  ↓
County ─→ Campaigns in their county
  ↓
Campaign → Their own data only
  ↓
Vendor ──→ States they serve
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Role-based access control with geographic boundaries
- Hierarchical permissions respecting political organization structures
- DRF permission classes for API endpoint protection
- Template utilities and view decorators for access checking

### 2. Authentication & User Management
- **Phone-based Authentication**: SMS-delivered PIN verification
- **Multi-factor Security**: PIN expiry and attempt limits
- **Rate Limiting**: SMS rate limiting for security
- **Custom User Model**: Extended Django user with role-based permissions

### 3. Campaign Management
- Campaign creation and management
- Geographic association (state/county)
- Campaign-specific data isolation
- Multi-campaign support for organizations

### 4. Voter Data Management
- Comprehensive voter database with enhanced fields
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Data enrichment through external APIs
- Geographic mapping and analysis

### 5. Billing & Payment Processing
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing
- Subscription management
- Usage tracking and billing
- Webhook handling for payment events

### 6. Communication & Outreach
- **SMS Capabilities**: Twilio integration for voter outreach
- **Email Services**: Automated campaign communications
- Rate limiting and compliance features
- Message tracking and analytics

### 7. Canvassing Tools
- Door-to-door canvassing support
- Real-time data collection
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Progress tracking and reporting

### 8. Integration Capabilities
- **External APIs**: FullContact, Spokeo, ZoomInfo for data enrichment
- **Analytics**: Segment integration for event tracking
- **Geographic Services**: Nominatim for address validation
- **Webhooks**: Real-time data synchronization
